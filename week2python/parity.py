# first step is to add colum 6 and row 6
# output the grid to the user
# ask the user for the coordinate of the card to flip
# e.g. input could be: (0,2)

## TASK 2

# given a six by six grid, work out what card was flipped
# â€‹
# your program should output the coordinate of the flipped card
# in this case it would be: (x,y)
